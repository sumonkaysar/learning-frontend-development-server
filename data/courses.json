This tutorial will teach your Tailwind from scratch, using a mix of lectures and interactive coding challenges. During this course we will be exploring the features of Tailwind CSS. As a quick recap, Tailwind is a utility-first framework designed to speed up the design process by completely removing the need for custom CSS. In the past, every HTML element would get a single class and that class would contain a lot of custom CSS in a separate CSS file. Though this is still the general practice, this practice leads to huge CSS files, reduces the ease of maintaining CSS and yields overall poorer developer experience.",
